<p> <b> Welcome! <b> This web application is the first step in enabling you to build your very own mobile application. </p>
<p> In order to do this, you can use this application to create user-specified questions at desired locations which will appear on the mobile app in their respective locations. </p>
<br></br>



<h2> <b> Key information: <b></h2>
<p> - Please ensure the httpServer.js is running. </p>
<p> - Please ensure all fields within the question form are populated. </p>
<p> - Please find more basemap layer selections available by selecting the layers button at the top right of the map</p>
<p> - When selecting the 'View Questions' button, ensure the blue location marker has been changed from previously submitted question location otherwise you will not be able to select the marker to drag it further. Additionally, selecting the 'Home' button will reset the map and therefore remove the 'View Questions' layer. </p>
